# Mobile Robot Simulation

This GitHub repository presents a mobile robot simulation featuring a rudimentary implementation of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). The simulation provides a platform for exploring and experimenting with the basics of SLAM techniques in the context of a mobile robot environment.

## Key Features:
- **Simulation Environment:** Explore a simulated environment where a mobile robot navigates and maps its surroundings.

- **Interactive Simulation:** The drive the robot around the  an intuitive interactive user interface, allowing users to specify the starting and ending positions, along with the desired direction for the car's trajectory.
- 
- **Rudimentary SLAM:** The simulation incorporates a basic SLAM implementation, allowing the robot to simultaneously localize itself and create a map of its environment.
